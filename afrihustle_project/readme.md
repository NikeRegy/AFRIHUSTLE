**AFRICA AGILITY HACKATHON - Product Brief for Group 5**
*SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth*

❖	Product Name: Afrihustle; where skill meets opportunity

❖	Product Idea and description:
Afrihustle is an all-inclusive, SMS-accessible, job-matching and upskilling platform designed for informal workers, gig workers, and artisans in Africa. This app helps to bridge the digital divide by ensuring access to products by end-users with (out) a smartphone or consistent internet access via USSD codes, WhatsApp, mobile app, and web platforms. It goes beyond simple job connections by offering financial inclusion and continuous skill development. The application uses advanced AI and location-based matching for accuracy and easy accessibility.

❖	SDG GOALS

Decent Work and Economic Growth

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 aims to promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. This goal recognizes that economic growth alone is not enough unless it creates quality jobs, ensures fair wages, and improves working conditions for everyone, particularly marginalized and low-income communities.

❖	PROBLEM STATEMENT
Millions of informal and low-income workers, especially in developing countries, struggle with:
●	High Unemployment & Underemployment: Many skilled and unskilled workers cannot find stable work, forcing them into low-paying, insecure jobs.
●	Job Insecurity & Informal Employment: A large percentage of workers in African countries are part of the informal sector, meaning they lack benefits such as job security, fair wages, and social protections.
●	Unfair Wages & Exploitation: Many workers are underpaid, overworked, and lack bargaining power.
●	Lack of Access to Job Opportunities and visibility: Many job seekers struggle due to limited internet access, poor networking, and a mismatch between their skills and available jobs.
●	Skills Gaps & Barriers to Employment: Many low-income workers lack the necessary education or training to access better-paying jobs.
Proposed Solution:
1} AI-Powered Job Matching – Uses intelligent algorithms to match workers with job opportunities.
2}Multi-Platform Access – Available via mobile app, website, and SMS to ensure accessibility for workers without smartphones.
3}Skill Development & Certification – Offers training programs to help workers upskill and increase their earning potential.
4}Integrated Payment & Financial Services – Enables secure payments, micro-loans, and savings options for informal workers.
5}Employer Verification & Ratings – Ensures trust and security by allowing workers and businesses to review each other. Opportunities based on their skills, location, and employer needs.
6} Geo location: We make services available any day in their locations, making sure artisans are always available in different locations.
